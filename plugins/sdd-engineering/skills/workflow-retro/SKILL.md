name: workflow-retro
description: Manual-only retrospective of a finished multi-agent workflow run — collects tokens, cache reads, tool calls, duration and parallelism (including nested subagents, whose spend never rolls up into the parent summary), turns them into concrete process changes, and appends one trend row to docs/retros/ledger.md. Invoke ONLY when the user explicitly asks for a workflow retro or types /workflow-retro. Never invoke it proactively, never chain it after another workflow, and never run it just because a pipeline finished.

# Workflow Retro

## Manual trigger only — this is a hard rule

Do **not** invoke this skill on your own initiative. Not after a `run-plan`
cycle finishes, not because a run looked expensive, not as a "helpful"
follow-up. It runs when the user explicitly asks for it and at no other time.
A retro that fires by itself defeats its own purpose: it adds cost to the very
run it is supposed to be measuring.

## Overview

Answers, for one session: how many tokens went where, how many agents ran and
in what order, what they duplicated, what they thrashed on, and what should
change next time. The output is **analysis plus concrete proposals**, not a
dashboard.

Two modes:

| Mode | Source | Accuracy | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `in-context` (default) | agent reports already in this conversation | **Approximate — undercounts badly, see below** | Quick read on a run you just watched |
| `deep` | `collect.sh` reads session JSONL from disk | Accurate | Anything you will act on or write to the ledger |

### Why `deep` exists, and why in-context numbers must be labelled

A parent agent's `toolUseResult.totalTokens` reports only the subagent's
**final API call**, not its cumulative spend. Measured on real sessions:
**4x to 56x undercount**. Depth-2 agents (a subagent that spawned its own
subagent) never appear in the parent's numbers at all.

So: in `in-context` mode you must state plainly that the figures are a floor,
not a total. Never write in-context numbers into the ledger.

## Step 1 — collect

Deep mode (default choice whenever the user wants real numbers):

```sh
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collect.sh              # newest session
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collect.sh <sessionId>  # a specific one
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/collect.sh --full ...   # no top-N truncation
```

Read-only, needs `jq`, emits one JSON object (~1–15 KB depending on session
size). Run it once and work from its output — do not re-derive the same
numbers with your own `jq` calls, and do not read raw transcripts unless the
JSON is genuinely missing something you need.

The scope is the **whole session**. If the user ran unrelated work in the same
session, say so rather than silently attributing it to the workflow.

Fields worth knowing:

- `tokens.weighted` — billable-weighted (cache write 1.25x, cache read 0.1x,
  output 5x, in units of base input tokens). **Rank agents by this**, not by
  `tokens.total`; a 40M-token session that is 95% cache read is far cheaper
  than the raw number suggests.
- `timeline` — launch order, one compact string per agent.
- `overlaps` — genuinely concurrent agents (ancestors excluded, since a parent
  is trivially "running" while its child runs). Empty means fully sequential.
- `duplicate_reads` — files read by more than one agent, repo-relative.
- `batch_histogram` — tool calls per assistant message; `batch: 1` dominating
  means almost no parallel tool use.
- `undercount_check` — parent-reported vs actual, kept as a standing check.
- per-agent `duration_s` — wall-clock seconds from that agent's first to last
  transcript record, **including idle waiting** (session left open, next-day
  continuation). Don't report this as work time — it's `main` on a session
  spanning days that badly inflates this number.
- per-agent `active_duration_s` (**report this one in the Agents table**) —
  sum of gaps between consecutive transcript events that are ≤ `idle_gap_s`
  (600s / 10 min by default, tune via `WORKFLOW_RETRO_IDLE_GAP_S` if a session
  has legitimately long tool calls). Gaps longer than that are dropped
  entirely, not clamped. `idle_s` / `idle_gaps` show how much was cut and how
  many breaks caused it — call these out in Notes when `idle_s` is large
  relative to `active_duration_s` (typically true for `main` on a multi-day
  session, rarely true for a subagent that ran start-to-finish).
- per-agent `skills` / session-level `skills_used` — which `Skill` tool calls
  each agent made (name + count), and the same rolled up across every agent in
  the session (not just the top-N in `agents`). An agent that never called
  `Skill` has an empty list — report it as "—", not as a gap in the data.
- per-agent `model` — for subagents, the model set on dispatch (from the
  agent's meta, e.g. `claude-sonnet-5`); for `main`, the unique set of models
  seen across its own requests, comma-joined. A `<synthetic>` entry in that
  set is a compaction/summary request, not a second model doing real work —
  don't report it as a model switch.

## Step 2 — interpret

Map signals to actions. Only report a finding when the data actually shows it —
a retro that invents problems is worse than no retro.

| Signal in the JSON | Action to propose |
|---|---|
| `duplicate_reads` with `n` ≥ 3 | Preload that file once and pass it in each agent's prompt, instead of N cold reads |
| `cache_read_pct` low (< ~50%) on a long run | Context is being rebuilt each turn — check prompt ordering and whether agents are handed stable prefixes |
| One agent's `weighted` ≫ the rest | Overloaded role — split it, or move mechanical work to a cheaper tier |
| Many `Grep`/`Glob`/`Bash ls` in an agent's `tools` | It was not told where to look — name the files in its prompt |
| `overlaps` empty across many independent agents | Concurrency unused — those could have been dispatched in one batch |
| `overlaps` large with contended files in `duplicate_reads` | Too much concurrency on shared state — reduce it |
| `batch_histogram` almost all `batch: 1` | Independent tool calls are being serialised — batch them |
| Same file in `duplicate_reads` **and** edited by several agents in `timeline` order | Rework / failed handoff — the earlier agent did not get what it needed |
| Expensive `model` on an agent whose `tools` are mostly mechanical | Drop that agent to a cheaper tier |
| `agents_omitted.count` large | Many small agents — check whether the fan-out was worth its per-agent overhead |

For the qualitative half, look for these in the agent reports and transcripts
(not in the collector's JSON, which is quantitative-only):

- **What was hard / easy** — retries, self-corrections, and "could not
  determine" sections in an agent's own report are the evidence.
- **Clarifying round-trips** — how often an agent needed re-prompting or
  correction mid-task. High on one agent points at an underspecified dispatch
  brief, not a slow agent.
- **Rework** — fix-loop iterations, retries, or re-spawns of the same agent
  for the same task.
- **Delegation correctness / scope drift** — did the right agent type take
  each task, and did each agent stay inside the paths/scope it was given.
- **Failure taxonomy** — terminal API errors, tool denials, blocked-on-human
  moments; categorize them so recurring friction is visible across runs, not
  just this one.

If you do not have the reports for a dimension, say so plainly — do not infer
difficulty, rework, or scope drift from token counts alone.

## Step 3 — report to chat

The report is written in **English** by default — headers, prose and table
content alike — unless the user explicitly requests this report (and the
ledger entry) in a different language, in which case follow that; you may
always summarize the findings verbally to the user in whatever language
they're using regardless. Lead with the actions, not the table. Structure:

```markdown
## Retro — <short session id>
**Scope**: whole session, N agents (max depth D), <wall-clock duration>
**Cost**: <weighted> weighted tokens (<raw> raw, <cache %> cache reads)

### Actions
1. <concrete change> — because <signal, with a number>
2. ...

### Agents
| Agent | Model | Duration | Skills | Tokens (weighted / raw) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| implementer/ab12cd34 | claude-sonnet-5 | 4m12s | onion-architecture, zod | 1.2M / 3.4M |
| plan-verifier/9f01aa22 | claude-sonnet-5 | 1m50s | — | 210K / 640K |

One row per agent (`agent` + `model` + `active_duration_s` (not
`duration_s` — that includes idle time) + `skills` + `tokens.weighted` /
`tokens.total` from the collector's JSON). An agent with zero `Skill` calls
gets "—" in the Skills column — that is not a gap in the data. If
`agents_omitted.count` > 0, add one line after the table: how many agents
did not fit and how much weighted spend they account for together. If an
agent (most often `main`) has `idle_s` significant relative to
`active_duration_s`, mention it in Notes — how much idle time was cut and
how many breaks (`idle_gaps`) caused it.

### Where the cost went
<top 3–5 agents by weighted, one line each, with a reason>

### Notes
<parallelism, the undercount ratio, anything the data doesn't answer>
```

Keep it short. Three well-evidenced actions beat ten speculative ones — the
per-agent table is the added detail, not a license to pad the narrative
sections.

## Step 4 — save the full report to file

The chat report from Step 3 does not persist — it scrolls out of history.
Write the **exact same markdown** (Actions, the Agents table, Where the cost
went, Notes) to `docs/retros/sessions/<short session id>.md` (create
`docs/retros/sessions/` if missing). One file per session, named after the
same short id used in the ledger's Session column — this is what Step 5 links
to, so write this file before appending the ledger row.

## Step 5 — append to the ledger, linking the report

Append **one row** to `docs/retros/ledger.md` (create the file with the header
below if missing). Append only — never rewrite or reorder past rows; the point
is the trend. The Session cell is a link to the file from Step 4, not bare
text:

```markdown
| Date | Session | Agents | Weighted | Raw | Cache | Tools | Wall | Top action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-11 | [0cc0c9d6](sessions/0cc0c9d6.md) | 90 (d2) | 49.9M | 103M | 94% | 1204 | 1h32m | Preload knowledge.ts — 12 agents read it separately |
```

One line, deep-mode numbers only, same as before — the ledger is still the
trend view, not the detail view. What changed: the per-agent breakdown from
Step 3 is no longer chat-only, so it survives past the current conversation
instead of disappearing once you write the one-line summary. If a row would
not be comparable to the ones above it, note why in the Top action cell rather
than padding the table with new columns.

## Common mistakes

- Running this automatically. See the top of this file.
- Writing in-context numbers into the ledger — they undercount by up to 56x.
- Ranking agents by `tokens.total` instead of `tokens.weighted`, which makes
  cache-heavy agents look expensive when they are not.
- Re-deriving statistics by hand with your own `jq` instead of reading the
  collector's output once — the retro then costs more than what it saves.
- Reporting every row of `duplicate_reads` as a problem. Two agents reading
  a shared project-instructions file is fine; twelve agents reading the same
  contract file is not.
- Appending the ledger row without first writing the Step 4 report file — the
  Session cell then links to nothing, and the per-agent detail is gone the
  moment the chat scrolls away.
